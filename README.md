# Hunt The Rumpus

## An Backstory

Deep within the Flatland Gridcaves, there lives a really mean, REALLY smelly Rumpus.
You, a Flatlander, are tasked with killing it. Should be easy, right?

If only the damn Flatland goverment wasn't a cheapskate. Sure, you get a gun more than capable of killing it, but you only get three bullets (the corpses of the previous mercs notwithstanding). Something about the manufacturing process. On top of that, they're too cheap to give you a light source, so you gotta do this blind.

It wouldn't be too bad if it weren't for the fact that rumpuses kill Flatlanders really, REALLY good. Like instant-death good.

## The Enclosed Instruction Book

(Treat this with a rock of salt!)

This game works a bit like a text adventure, [n|e|w|s] taking you [north|east|west|south] respectively.
[g] will prime your rumpus gun, the direction to fire determined by the same four directions.
[d] has your built-in device contact Dennis, your lifeline, who'll dispense a hint or two. This'll only work once, though!

But most of all, don't do a dying, as the Flatlander goverment counts on you! How else will they squander the taxes the citizens pay per year?

## Compilation 'n Stuff

Though pre-compiled binaries (and a dedicated AUR package) will be included at a later date, compiling the program manually with GCC should be enough to get it going.

Windows users can use WSL, and if you use a Mac, may god have mercy on your soul.
